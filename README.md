## [The Sequential model API](https://github.com/fernandofsilva/Keras/tree/main/Sequential%20API)

There are multiple ways to build and apply deep learning models in TensorFlow, from high-level, quick and easy-to-use APIs, to low-level operations.

## [Validation, regularisation and callbacks](https://github.com/fernandofsilva/Keras/tree/main/Validation%2C%20regularisation%20and%20callbacks)

Model validation and selection is an essential part of developing any machine learning model development to help prevent overfitting and improve generalisation.
